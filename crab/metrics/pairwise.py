"""Utilities to evaluate pairwise distances or metrics between 2
sets of points.

Distance metrics are a function d(a, b) such that d(a, b) < d(a, c) if objects
a and b are considered "more similar" to objects a and c. Two objects exactly
alike would have a distance of zero.
One of the most popular examples is Euclidean distance.
To be a 'true' metric, it must obey the following four conditions::

    1. d(a, b) >= 0, for all a and b
    2. d(a, b) == 0, if and only if a = b, positive definiteness
    3. d(a, b) == d(b, a), symmetry
    4. d(a, c) <= d(a, b) + d(b, c), the triangle inequality

def check_pairwise_arrays(X, Y):
    """ Set X and Y appropriately and checks inputs

    If Y is None, it is set as a pointer to X (i.e. not a copy).
    If Y is given, this does not happen.
    All distance metrics should use this function first to assert that the
    given parameters are correct and safe to use.

    Specifically, this function first ensures that both X and Y are arrays,
    then checks that they are at least two dimensional. Finally, the function
    checks that the size of the second dimension of the two arrays is equal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples_a, n_features]

    Y : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples_b, n_features]

    Returns
    -------
    safe_X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples_a, n_features]
        An array equal to X, guarenteed to be a numpy array.

    safe_Y : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples_b, n_features]
        An array equal to Y if Y was not None, guarenteed to be a numpy array.
        If Y was None, safe_Y will be a pointer to X.
